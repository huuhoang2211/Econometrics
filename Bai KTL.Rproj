## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r library}
library(car)
library(psych)
library(Hmisc)
library(dplyr)
library(lmtest)
```

##The purpose of this research is to test the regression model that illustrates the relationships between the dependent variable (VNINDEX indicator value from 2013 to 2014), and three independent variables, which are the stock price of MBB, VCB, CTG (in the same period)

```{r importing data}
Model=read.csv(file.choose(),header=TRUE)
```

```{r regression model}
luu<-lm(data=Model,VNINDEX~CTG+VCB+MBB)
summary(luu)
```

```{r multicollinearity test}
vif(luu)
```
##Since the VIF indicator of CTG, VCB, MBB are smaller than 5, we can conclude that the multicollinearity problem doesn't exist.

```{r non-constant variance test}
ncvTest(luu)
```
## We can see that p-value is smaller than 0.05, which indicates that the non-constant variance error does exist.

```{r Autocorrelation test}
durbinWatsonTest(luu)

```
## Here we can see that p-value is smaller than 0.05, which means that the the model has autocorrelation error.

##Now we can try to solve these problems by including a lagged variable called VNINDEX3
```{r lagged value}
Model <- Model %>%
  mutate( VNINDEX3 = lag(VNINDEX))
  luu1<-lm(data=Model, VNINDEX~CTG+VCB+MBB+VNINDEX3)
  summary(luu1)
```

##Now we test new model
```{r test new model multicolinearity error}
vif(luu1)
```
## All variables have VIF < 5 -> no multicollinearity

```{r test new model non-constant variance error}
ncvTest(luu1)
```
## the p-value here is greater than 0.05. Hence, we can conclude that the non-constant variance error doesn't exist in the new model.

```{r test new model autocorrelation error}
durbinWatsonTest(luu1)
```
##p-value = 0.25, which is greater than 0.05, so we can conclude that our model don't have autocorrelation error.

```{r ramsey test }
resettest(luu1)
```
## the p-value here is greater than 0.05, so our function form is correct.
